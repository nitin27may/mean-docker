A modern, full-stack TypeScript contact management system built with the MEAN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, Angular, Node.js) and containerized with Docker. Perfect for learning full-stack development or as a starting point for your own projects!

## üåü What You'll Learn

- **TypeScript** throughout the entire stack
- **Angular 19** with reactive forms, guards, and SSR
- **Express.js** with TypeScript for a robust API
- **MongoDB** integration with Mongoose
- **JWT Authentication** for secure user management
- **Docker** containerization for development and production
- **Nginx** as a load balancer and API gateway
- **CI/CD** with GitHub Actions

## üöÄ Getting Started in 30 Seconds

## üèóÔ∏è System Architecture

</p>

### Single Entry Point Architecture

When using the `docker-compose.nginx.yml` configuration, all traffic flows through a single port (80):

- **Single Exposed Port**: Only port 80 is exposed to the outside world
- **Unified Access Point**: Both UI and API requests enter through Nginx
- **Intelligent Routing**: 
  - Requests to `/api/*` are proxied to the Express.js service
  - All other requests are served by the Angular frontend
- **Simplified Deployment**: No need to manage multiple public endpoints
- **Enhanced Security**: Internal services remain isolated from direct external access

## üíª Key Features

### User Authentication

- Protected routes with Angular guards
- Token-based API authorization
- Password change functionality

### Contact Management

- Create, read, update, and delete contacts
- Responsive design for mobile and desktop
- Form validation with custom error messages
- Search, sort, and paginate contacts
